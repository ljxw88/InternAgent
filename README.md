## 📖 Overview

![InternAgent](assets/internagent_overall.png)

**InternAgent 1.5** is a unified autonomous system for end-to-end scientific discovery across both **Algorithm Discovery** and **Empirical Discovery**. Building on InternAgent 1.0, it organizes scientific inquiry into three coordinated subsystems: **Generation** (hypothesis construction via deep research), **Verification** (methodological evaluation via solution refinement), and **Evolution** (evidence-driven refinement via long-horizon memory).
![Benchmark](assets/benchmark.png)
InternAgent 1.5 achieves **leading performance** on scientific reasoning benchmarks (GAIA, HLE, GPQA, FrontierScience, SGI-bench) and demonstrates **sustained autonomous optimization** across extended discovery cycles. The system supports **algorithm discovery** (agent memory, reinforcement learning, test-time scaling, ...) and **empirical discovery** workflows (dry-lab simulations and wet-lab experimentation) across Physical, Biological, Earth, and Life Sciences.

## 🌟 Core Features

![Framework](assets/internagent_framework.png)

InternAgent 1.5 is built on three foundational subsystems that enable autonomous scientific discovery:

### 🔍 Generation: Deep Research for Hypothesis Construction
- Autonomous literature analysis and knowledge synthesis across scientific domains
- Multi-source information integration from papers, code repositories, and domain-specific databases
- Structured hypothesis formulation grounded in existing scientific evidence

### ✅ Verification: Solution Refinement for Methodological Evaluation
- Systematic transformation of hypotheses into executable experimental protocols
- Automated code generation, debugging, and execution across computational and experimental environments
- Exception-guided intelligent error correction and iterative solution optimization

### 🔄 Evolution: Long-Horizon Memory for Evidence-Driven Refinement
- Persistent memory architecture that accumulates knowledge across extended research cycles
- Cross-iteration learning from experimental outcomes and methodological feedback
- Adaptive optimization that continuously refines hypotheses and experimental designs

### 🧩 Three-Subsystem Coordination
- **Generation → Verification → Evolution** forms a complete discovery cycle
- Seamless integration of dry-lab (computational modeling) and wet-lab (physical experimentation) workflows
- Extensible architecture supporting diverse tasks across Algorithm Discovery and Empirical Discovery

**InternAgent 1.5** delivers end-to-end autonomous scientific discovery, enabling researchers to complete the full cycle—from hypothesis generation to experimental validation—across Physical, Biological, Earth, and Life Sciences.

## 🤖 Running with LiteLLM + GitHub Copilot

This fork is pre-configured to use **LiteLLM** as a local proxy, routing all InternAgent LLM calls through **GitHub Copilot** models (gpt-4o, o3-mini, etc.) — no OpenAI API key required.

### Prerequisites

- A GitHub account with an active **GitHub Copilot** subscription
- - A GitHub personal access token with `copilot` scope
 
  - ### Setup
 
  - **1. Install dependencies**
  - ```bash
    conda create -n InternAgent python=3.11
    conda activate InternAgent
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python -m pip install -U --upgrade-strategy only-if-needed aider-chat
    ```

    **2. Configure environment**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Edit .env and set your GITHUB_TOKEN
    ```

    **3. Start the LiteLLM proxy** (in a separate terminal)
    ```bash
    # Option A: Simple one-liner (uses gpt-4o via Copilot)
    litellm --model github_copilot/gpt-4o --port 4000

    # Option B: Use the full config file (recommended — includes fallbacks, retry logic)
    litellm --config litellm_config.yaml --port 4000
    ```

    **4. Run InternAgent**
    ```bash
    ./scripts/run_pipeline.sh
    ```

    ### How It Works

    ```
    InternAgent agents
           │
           ▼ (OpenAI-compatible API calls to localhost:4000)
      LiteLLM proxy
           │
           ▼ (authenticated with GITHUB_TOKEN)
    GitHub Copilot API
           │
           ▼
      gpt-4o / o3-mini
    ```

    InternAgent's `openai` provider is pointed at `http://localhost:4000` (set via `OPENAI_API_BASE_URL` in `.env`). LiteLLM translates the calls and forwards them to GitHub Copilot.

    ### Switching Models

    Edit `litellm_config.yaml` or use the CLI flag to switch between Copilot-available models:

    | Model | LiteLLM flag |
    |---|---|
    | GPT-4o | `--model github_copilot/gpt-4o` |
    | o3-mini | `--model github_copilot/o3-mini` |
    | Claude 3.5 Sonnet | `--model github_copilot/claude-3.5-sonnet` |

    Then update `model_name` in `config/config.yaml` to match.
